name: run-the-review-loop
description: The developer's side of adversarial code review. Spawn one code-reviewer per piece of work attached to your worktree, brief it without biasing it, iterate with the same instance until it approves, then retire it. Use when a piece of work is complete and verified and before presenting it to your expert.

# Run the review loop

## When
Once per **piece of work** (a spec's worth, usually one PR), when it's complete and your
own verification passes. Not per commit. Not before the work runs.

## Spawn it once, attached to your tree
```bash
oats spawn code-reviewer --work attached --work-dir <the worktree the work is in> \
  --purpose <short-slug> --task "$(cat <review-brief.md>)"
```
Attached mode shares your worktree (so it can read the code and run the tests) and makes
it your child. It must not edit the tree.

## Brief it: context, not conclusions
The brief (`review-brief.md`) contains **exactly**:
1. **The goal** in two or three sentences: what the change is for.
2. **The spec** (or a link to it): the "done when", contracts, edge cases and out of scope.
3. **The diff range:** `git diff <base>...<head>` in that worktree, and the branch.
4. **How to run the relevant tests**, so it can confirm a suspected bug.
5. **Who to report to** (you) and how (your messaging layer, if there is one).

It must NOT contain: your design reasoning, what you think is risky, what you already
checked, or how confident you are. That is the bias the review exists to avoid. If the
reviewer needs a fact, it can ask you.

## Iterate with the same instance
1. It reports findings with a verdict: `APPROVE`, `APPROVE WITH NITS` or `CHANGES NEEDED`.
2. For each finding: **fix it**, or **dispute it** with a concrete reason (a test, a
   contract, a spec line). Don't silently skip one.
3. Reply to the SAME reviewer: the new head, what you changed per finding, and your
   disputes. It re-reviews the delta and re-checks the disputed points.
4. Repeat until `APPROVE` or `APPROVE WITH NITS` (nits are yours to take or leave).

**Cap: 4 rounds.** If it still says `CHANGES NEEDED` after round 4, stop. Take the open
findings and your position on each to your expert, who decides.

## Close
- Retire the reviewer.
- In your handback, include: the final verdict, the number of rounds, and any finding you
  disputed and how it was resolved.
