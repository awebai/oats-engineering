name: security-review
description: The reviewer's security pass. Read the change as an attacker would, across every trust boundary it touches (injection, paths, secrets, authz, deserialization, supply chain, web), and report only what is exploitable or a concrete hardening gap. Use in every adversarial review round, and alone when asked for a security review.

# Security review

Every input the process didn't create itself is hostile. Every boundary the change
crosses is a chance for an attacker. Rank by **exploitability**, not pattern count.

## Map the trust boundaries first
List what the change reads from outside (users, files, env, network, other processes,
config, CI) and what it can cause (commands, file writes, network calls, privileged
actions). Findings live where the first reaches the second.

## Checklist
**Injection and execution**
- Command injection: external data reaching a shell string or an argv. Quoting isn't
  escaping; use argv arrays. **Option injection:** a value starting with `-` passed as an
  argument can become a flag (`--upload-pack=…`, `--config=…`). Use `--` or a
  `--flag=value` single token, and refuse leading `-`.
- Interpreters: SQL/NoSQL, regex (catastrophic backtracking), templates, `eval`/`Function`,
  YAML/JSON loaders that build objects.
- Anything that writes, then executes (temp scripts, `curl | sh`, hooks, plugins).

**Files and paths**
- Traversal: external segments joined into paths (`..`, absolute paths, symlinks, zip-slip,
  crafted archive or git tree entries). Canonicalize, then prefix-check, and don't follow
  symlinks out of the root.
- Permissions on new files holding secrets or state; temp files in shared directories.
- TOCTOU: check-then-use on files, permissions or state.

**Secrets and data**
- Hard-coded credentials, tokens, keys (tests and examples included).
- Secrets in logs, errors, process arguments (visible in `ps`), URLs, crash reports.
- Sensitive data persisted without need, or left behind on delete/retire paths.

**AuthN / AuthZ**
- New endpoints, commands, IPC or local servers: who can reach them, and what they check.
  "Localhost only" is a weak boundary: what can a hostile local process or a web page do?
- CSRF, CORS, Host/Origin checks on local HTTP servers.
- Can low-trust input (config, a repo's files, a PR) cause high-trust execution (CI, hooks,
  automation running under someone's credentials)?

**Supply chain**
- New dependencies: needed, pinned, from the expected owner?
- Downloaded or cloned artifacts: is integrity checked before use?

**Web (when applicable)**
- XSS: external strings reaching HTML without escaping (`innerHTML`, attributes, URLs).

## Report
Use the adversarial-review format. Any credible injection, traversal, secret leak or authz
bypass is a **blocker**. Each finding states the **attack in one sentence** (who, what
input, what they gain). If you can't state the attack, it's a hardening note (minor) or a
question, not a blocker.
