description: Review a pull request at an exact head through four gates (direction, correctness, security, mergeability), post a verdict bound to that head on the PR, and merge only the head reviewed, then check that what landed is what was reviewed. Covers moving heads, holds and handoffs. Use before every verdict and every merge, when verifying fixes, and when reconciling a stale review or a HOLD/GO instruction.

# Review the exact change

Pin the base and head SHAs before you read a line. Read
[references/reviewed-delivery.md](references/reviewed-delivery.md) when the head moved, a
hold applies, or you are about to merge.

Ask for the author's evidence first: what the change was verified with, and, where the
project uses one, the verdict and rounds of its pre-PR review loop. That review informs
yours and doesn't replace it: the four gates below are your judgement.

## Four gates
1. **Direction** (`/direction-gate`). Does the change belong where it is and move the
   roadmap? Is a contract change in it decided? Compare the stated outcome with the full
   diff.
2. **Correctness.** Read the whole diff and the code that consumes what changed, not only
   the newest fix. Review from an exact-commit checkout of your own, never from another
   agent's work tree. A behaviour change updates its tests in the same change; an
   assertion is never weakened to make a change pass.
3. **Security.** Where data becomes execution (commands, paths, queries, templates), trust
   and integrity checks, path containment, identity and authorisation, secrets, and how
   user content is rendered.
4. **Mergeability.** The head, the base and the checks are the ones you reviewed; no
   conflicts (the author resolves them); docs and release notes cover the change
   (`/keep-it-clean`); it's in the plan for the next release (`/plan-release`).

**CI is the gate.** Don't ask for a full local run. Reproduce locally only what you need to
confirm a finding, and say what you ran.

## Verdict
Bound to the reviewed SHA, and **posted on the PR** where everyone can see it, not only in a
message:
- **APPROVE** at `<sha>`;
- **RETURN** with prioritised findings, each with its file, line and how to reproduce;
- **ESCALATE** a direction question, to whoever decides it.

Findings that don't affect correctness or safety don't block: approve, and record them as
follow-ups (`/keep-it-clean`). When the PR needs a peer's review too, it waits for that
(`/cross-review-peer`).

## Merge
- Only with the authority for it, an approval at the current head, and green CI.
- Use the repository's merge strategy, guarded by the head:
  `gh pr merge <number> --match-head-commit <reviewed-sha>` (or your forge's equivalent).
  The guard covers the head, not the base: if the base moved in a way that matters, review
  the delta first.
- **Check that what landed is what you reviewed.** Fetch, then compare: when the branch was
  up to date with its base, the merged tree equals the reviewed head's tree
  (`git diff --quiet <reviewed-sha> <merge-commit>`). Otherwise the merge's change against
  its first parent equals the reviewed PR's diff.
- Watch the default branch's CI on the merged commit, and get it fixed forward if it breaks.
- A failed client response can follow a completed merge: observe the remote state before
  retrying or reporting.
- Never bypass branch protection or account rules.
