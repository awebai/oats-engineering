name: pr-review
description: Review a pull request at an exact head through four gates (direction, correctness, security, mergeability), post a verdict bound to that head on the PR, and merge only the head reviewed, then check that what landed is what was reviewed. Covers moving heads, holds and handoffs. Use before every verdict and every merge, when verifying fixes, and when reconciling a stale review or a HOLD/GO instruction.

# Review the exact change

**Review only what its owner hands over.** Start on a PR only when its owner (the expert
landing it) hands it to you, saying three things: the developer's review loop converged
(its final verdict and rounds, where the project runs one), the exact head, and CI green
on that head. Until then, don't review it, don't run reviewers or subagents on it, and
don't send findings: a head that is still moving isn't reviewable. If the head moves after
the hand-over, stop and wait for the owner's next hand-over; then review only the delta,
and re-bind your verdict to the new head.

Pin the base and head SHAs before you read a line. Read
[references/reviewed-delivery.md](references/reviewed-delivery.md) when the head moved, a
hold applies, or you are about to merge.

Ask for the author's evidence first: what the change was verified with, and, where the
project uses them, the verdict and rounds of its pre-PR code review and the owning expert's
acceptance. Check that they were given **at this head**; if not, the hand-over isn't complete: ask
its owner for one at this head. Those reviews inform yours and don't replace it: the four gates
below are your judgement.

**Read the PR as a whole first.** Does the description's claim match the diff? Is the
scope what was asked, or did unrelated changes ride along? Are the issue, the spec and the
PRs it depends on linked?

## Four gates
1. **Direction** (`/direction-gate`). Does the change belong where it is and move the
   roadmap? Is a contract change in it decided? Compare the stated outcome with the full
   diff.
2. **Correctness.** Read the whole diff, not only the newest fix, and **find the consumers
   of everything it changes:** search for each changed export, function signature, output
   or message shape, config key, flag, error code and file format, in this repository and
   in the repositories that depend on it, and read how each consumer uses it. Your
   project's own review notes may list the usual consumers; the search still runs. Review
   from an exact-commit checkout of your own, never from another agent's work tree. A
   behaviour change updates its tests in the same change; an assertion is never weakened
   to make a change pass.
3. **Security.** Where data becomes execution (commands, paths, queries, templates), trust
   and integrity checks, path containment, identity and authorisation, secrets, and how
   user content is rendered. Also:
   - **PRs from forks or first-time contributors:** CI that would run their code with
     secrets or write permissions, and any change to CI workflows, permissions or secrets
     handling, are reviewed before CI runs them.
   - **Dependencies:** every new or bumped dependency is a supply-chain change. Check that
     it's needed, where it comes from, that the version is pinned, and that the lockfile
     change matches the manifest change and nothing else.
4. **Mergeability.** The head, the base and the checks are the ones you reviewed; no
   conflicts (the author resolves them); no unresolved review threads, and other
   reviewers' and bots' comments answered; not a draft. Docs and release notes cover the
   change (`/keep-it-clean`), and it's in the plan for the next release
   (`/plan-release`). A PR too large to review well is split before it's reviewed.

**CI is the gate.** Don't ask for a full local run. Reproduce locally only what you need to
confirm a finding, and say what you ran.

## Verdict
Bound to the reviewed SHA, and **posted on the PR** where everyone can see it, not only in a
message: as a review, or as a comment stating the verdict and the SHA where the forge
refuses the approval (an author can't approve its own PR, and agents sharing one account
can't approve each other):
- **APPROVE** at `<sha>`;
- **RETURN** with prioritised findings, each with its file, line and how to reproduce;
- **ESCALATE** a direction question, to whoever decides it.

Findings that affect neither correctness, safety, direction nor a coherence rule don't
block: approve, and record them as follow-ups (`/keep-it-clean`). Direction and
coherence-rule findings do block. When the PR needs a peer's review too, it waits for that
(`/cross-review-peer`).

## Merge
- Only with the authority for it, an approval at the current head, every approval your
  peer agreement requires (`/cross-review-peer`), and green CI.
- Use the repository's merge strategy, guarded by the head:
  `gh pr merge <number> --match-head-commit <reviewed-sha>` (or your forge's equivalent).
  The guard covers the head, not the base: if the base moved in a way that matters, review
  the delta first. A merge queue or auto-merge has its own guard: check that it merges the
  head you reviewed.
- **Check that what landed is what you reviewed.** Fetch, and find the merge commit
  (`gh pr view <number> --json mergeCommit -q .mergeCommit.oid`). Then:
  - **squash or merge commit, branch up to date with its base:** the merged tree equals
    the reviewed head's (`git diff --quiet <reviewed-sha> <merge-commit>`);
  - **squash or merge commit, base moved:** the merge's own change
    (`git diff <merge-commit>^ <merge-commit>`) matches the reviewed diff
    (`git diff <base-at-review>...<reviewed-sha>`); surrounding context may differ;
  - **rebase merge:** compare the rebased commits with the reviewed ones
    (`git range-diff <base-at-review>..<reviewed-sha> <new-base>..<tip>`).
- Watch the default branch's CI on the merged commit, and get it fixed forward if it breaks.
- A failed client response can follow a completed merge: observe the remote state before
  retrying or reporting.
- Never bypass branch protection or account rules.
