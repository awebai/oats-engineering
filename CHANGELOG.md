# Changelog

## 1.2.0 - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- Requires OATS 0.30.0 or later (was 0.29.0): the packaged soul now declares a launch preference, a 0.30 key that 0.29 refuses.
- The packaged `code-reviewer` soul prefers Codex with `gpt-6-astra` (`launch: { harness: codex, model: gpt-6-astra }`), a different model family from the developers it reviews. A machine overrides it in `oats-local.yaml` `souls.launch`; spawn flags win over both.
- On a machine without the `codex` binary, spawning `code-reviewer` is refused with `E_HARNESS_UNAVAILABLE` until Codex is installed or the machine overrides the preference (`oats-local.yaml` `souls.launch`, or `--harness`/`--model` at spawn).
- Vendored OATS schemas refreshed from OATS v0.30.0.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-09-28

### Added

- Developer documentation maintenance skill: `/maintain-dev-docs`.
- Code-review documentation review skill: `/review-dev-docs`.
- Review-loop guidance to pick a different reviewer model.

### Changed

- The developer's step 3 is now "Consolidate, verify, document."

## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-28

- Initial official release of `oats.engineering` with `oats.engineering-expert`,
  `oats.developer`, `oats.code-review`, and the packaged `code-reviewer` soul.
